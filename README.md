- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- The project involves building an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer. The main problem it aims to solve is helping the store analyze the text records of purchased items generated throughout the day. By analyzing these records and determining the frequency of item purchases, the program will assist the store in rearranging its produce section to create a more efficient layout for its customers.
- What did you do particularly well?
- The program reads the user's input and executes the corresponding function based on the selected option.
- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- Separate the functionality into smaller, reusable functions: Instead of having all the menu options implemented as separate functions within the CornerGrocer class, consider separating each menu option into its own function. This improves code readability, and modularity, and allows for easier maintenance and testing.
- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- For me, the hardest part of writing this program was adding the program's ability to read the text file and count the frequency of produce in the txt file. To overcome it, I spent a lot of time reading up on implementing .txt files, and how to call on the files, and basically spent a lot of time gaining a stronger understanding of the use of .txt files in code. https://cplusplus.com/ was a great resource paired with youtube.
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
- I have gained experience in reading from and writing to files using the ifstream and ofstream classes. This skill is useful in many applications that involve data persistence or processing external data. I have used the unordered_map data structure from the C++ Standard Library to store word frequencies. Understanding and working with different data structures is essential for efficient data organization and retrieval in various programming tasks. The project involves processing and analyzing data by counting word frequencies. This demonstrates algorithmic thinking and data processing skills, which are applicable to a wide range of projects involving data analysis, text processing, or information retrieval. The project demonstrates the use of classes and functions to organize code into logical units. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns. Applying modular design principles to my code is beneficial in any software development project.
- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- The program is organized into a class (CornerGrocer) with separate member functions for different menu options. This modular structure enhances code readability, promotes code reuse, and allows for easier maintenance and modification in the future. The functions and variables are named descriptively, conveying their purpose and functionality. This helps in understanding the code's intent and makes it easier to navigate and modify. Relevant comments are provided throughout the code to explain the purpose and functionality of different sections. These comments enhance code readability and assist other developers in understanding the code's logic and flow. Each member function focuses on a specific task, such as displaying the menu, searching for an item, or creating a file and histogram. This separation of concerns makes the code more modular, maintainable, and adaptable. The menu options are presented in a clear and visually appealing format, making it easier for the user to understand and interact with the program.
